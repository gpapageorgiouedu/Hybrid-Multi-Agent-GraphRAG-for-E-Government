ABSTRACT = {As public institutions increasingly adopt AI-driven virtual assistants to support transparency and citizen engagement, the need for explainable, accurate, and context-aware language systems becomes vital. While traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks effectively integrate external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), their reliance on flat, unstructured document retrieval limits multi-hop reasoning and interpretability, especially with complex, structured e-government datasets. This study introduces a modular, extensible, multi-agent graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework designed to enhance policy-focused question answering. This research aims to provide an overview of hybrid multi-agent GraphRAG architecture designed for operational deployment in e-government settings to support explainable AI systems. The study focuses on how the hybrid integration of standard RAG, embedding-based retrieval, real-time web search, and LLM-generated structured Graphs can optimize knowledge discovery from public e-government data, thereby reinforcing factual grounding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing the quality of complex responses. To validate the proposed approach, we implement and evaluate the framework using the European Commissionâ€™s Press Corner as a data source, constructing graph-based knowledge representations and embeddings, and incorporating web search. This work establishes a reproducible blueprint for deploying AI systems in e-government that require structured reasoning in comprehensive and factually accurate question answering.},

## Introduction

The repository contains a [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) application designed to run in Google Colab. It is built using the robust open-source [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) framework, which provides an end-to-end solution for Large Language Models (LLMs).

The application offers a web-based interface for interacting with Generative AI models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini, allowing for modular selection of models. It supports a modular and extensible Multi-Agent, Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) framework designed to enhance policy-focused question answering. Users can index their data in their Neo4J database and engage in interactive conversations with the Gen AI models of their choice. Moreover, they can assess the faithfulness of their pipelines using the custom-made LLM-based evaluators.


## Example Use Case

The use case presented in our research focuses on enhancing E-Government Services through a state-of-the-art, modular, and reproducible Multi-Agent architecture utilizing, Graphs, Embeddings, Web Search and LLMs.

In our example, we use publicly available sources, such as the [Press Corner](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner) and Web Search. The Press Corner data used complies with the terms of use policy, and all appropriate credit goes to the Press Corner. Please note that this repository is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by the Press Corner.

Our approach emphasizes modularity and reproducibility, with all pipelines, custom GraphRAG components, and setups designed to be flexible and customizable. Users can apply different AI models, utilize their databases, integrate web search tools, implement various preprocessing steps, deploy agents, and define their data sources.


## Access Instructions

Example indexing and querying pipelines, along with LLM-based faithfulness evaluation, are set up as demonstrated in our research. For usage, you will need to create your own index. All components are modular and scalable, allowing graph setups, embeddings index, generative AI models, custom retrievals, prompts, evaluators, and other elements to be modified as per users' preferences.
